# Theory
• Precision- Ability of a classification model to identify only the relevant data points.
It is defined as the number of true positives divided by the number true positives + the number of false positives.

• Recall- Ability of a model to find all the relevant cases within a dataset.
The precise definition of recall is the number of true positives divided by the number of true positives plus the number of false negatives.

•Accuracy-It is the number of correct predictions made by the model divided by the total number of predictions.
