# Theory
• Precision- Ability of a classification model to identify only the relevant data points.
It is defined as the number of true positives divided by the number true positives + the number of false positives.

• Recall- Ability of a model to find all the relevant cases within a dataset.
The precise definition of recall is the number of true positives divided by the number of true positives plus the number of false negatives.

•Accuracy-It is the number of correct predictions made by the model divided by the total number of predictions.

• F1-Score
In cases where we want to find an optimal blend of precision and recall we can combine the two metrics using what is called the F1 score.

#Supervised learning

Basically supervised learning is when we teach or train the machine using data that is well labelled. Which means some data is already tagged with the correct answer. After that, the machine is provided with a new set of examples(data) so that the supervised learning algorithm analyses the training data(set of training examples) and produces a correct outcome from labelled data.

Types:-
Regression
Logistic Regression
Classification
Naive Bayes Classifiers
K-NN (k nearest neighbors)
Decision Trees
Support Vector Machine

Advantages:-
*Supervised learning allows collecting data and produces data output from previous experiences.
*Helps to optimize performance criteria with the help of experience.
*Supervised machine learning helps to solve various types of real-world computation problems.
*It performs classification and regression tasks.
*It allows estimating or mapping the result to a new sample. 
*We have complete control over choosing the number of classes we want in the training data.

Disadvantages:-
*Classifying big data can be challenging.
*Training for supervised learning needs a lot of computation time. So, it requires a lot of time.
*Supervised learning cannot handle all complex tasks in Machine Learning.
*Computation time is vast for supervised learning.
*It requires a labelled data set.
*It requires a training process.
 
 
 #Unsupervised Learning
 
 Unsupervised learning is the training of a machine using information that is neither classified nor labeled and allowing the algorithm to act on that information without guidance. Here the task of the machine is to group unsorted information according to similarities, patterns, and differences without any prior training of data. 
 
The two categories of algorithms: 
1)Clustering: A clustering problem is where you want to discover the inherent groupings in the data, such as grouping customers by purchasing behavior.
Association: An association rule learning problem is where you want to discover rules that describe large portions of your data, such as people that buy X also tend to buy Y.
Types of Unsupervised Learning:-
Clustering
Exclusive (partitioning)
Agglomerative
Overlapping
Probabilistic

Clustering Types:-
Hierarchical clustering
K-means clustering
Principal Component Analysis
Singular Value Decomposition
Independent Component Analysis

Advantages of unsupervised learning:
*It does not require a training data to be labelled.
*Dimensionality reduction can be easily accomplished using unsupervised learning. 
*Capable of finding previously unknown patterns in data.

Disadvantages of unsupervised learning :
*Difficult to measure accuracy or effectiveness due to lack of predefined answers during training. 
*The results often have lesser accuracy.
*The user needs to spend time interpreting and label the classes which follow that classification.
